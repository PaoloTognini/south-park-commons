Here are some of my projects.
The folder "The_Challenge" contains a one-player 2D game with 150+ tiles where you have to collect chips and reach the exits, while avoiding monsters and facing countless situations. I wrote the code by myself from scratch, inspired by Chip's Challenge by Chuck Sommerville.
The folder "games" contains other small games I wrote for fun.
The "FrameFormer" slides explain the FrameFormer, a road to Artificial General Intelligence, a project I and my teammate Marco Eterno worked on with the participation of the Italian company Indigo.ai (https://indigo.ai/en/ )
The "PET busters" slides are named after the startup proposal PET busters of building a prototype to degrade PET plastic using bacteria. It won the PhD+ competition of the Contamination Lab of Pisa, Italy, in 2023 (http://contaminationlab.unipi.it/en/phd/ ).
