Here are some of my projects.
1) The folder "The_Challenge" contains a one-player 2D game with 150+ tiles where you have to collect chips and reach the Exit, while avoiding monsters and facing countless situations. I wrote the code by myself from scratch, inspired by Chip's Challenge by Chuck Sommerville.
2) The folder "games" contains other small games I wrote for fun.
3) The "FrameFormer" slides explain the FrameFormer, a road to Artificial General Intelligence, a project I and my teammate Marco Eterno worked on with the participation of the Italian company Indigo.ai (https://indigo.ai/en/ )
4) The "PET busters" slides are named after the startup proposal PET busters of building a prototype to degrade PET plastic using bacteria. It won the PhD+ competition of the Contamination Lab of Pisa, Italy, in 2023 (http://contaminationlab.unipi.it/en/phd/ ).
5) The "Analysis Lecture Notes" are the first Lecture Notes I wrote for the stage organized by me and other members of Scuola Normale of Pisa, to train high school students from all over Italy to the Italian and International Physics Olympiads. The first Lecture I gave can be found in the stage website (https://stagefisica.sns.it/lezioni/lezioni-pdf/lezione/1/ ).
